# High Issues

## H-1: Unprotected initializer

Consider protecting the initializer functions with modifiers.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 324](src/kannon_v1.sol#L324)

	```solidity
	    function _addInitialLiquidity(
	```

- Found in src/kannon_v1_library.sol [Line: 100](src/kannon_v1_library.sol#L100)

	```solidity
	    function calculateInitialSqrtPrice(address token0, address token1, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
	```

</details>



## H-2: Unsafe Casting

Downcasting int/uints in Solidity can be unsafe due to the potential for data loss and unintended behavior.When downcasting a larger integer type to a smaller one (e.g., uint256 to uint128), the value may exceed the range of the target type,leading to truncation and loss of significant digits. Use OpenZeppelin's SafeCast library to safely downcast integers.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 543](src/kannon_v1.sol#L543)

	```solidity
	            amount0Max: uint128(amount0),
	```

- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 544](src/kannon_v1.sol#L544)

	```solidity
	            amount1Max: uint128(amount1)
	```

</details>



## H-3: Functions send eth away from contract but performs no checks on any address.

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 550](src/kannon_v1.sol#L550)

	```solidity
	    function swapExactTokensForETH(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount, uint32 dstEid)
	```

</details>



## H-4: Return value of the function call is not checked.

Function returns a value but it is ignored.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 418](src/kannon_v1.sol#L418)

	```solidity
	            _lzComposeSwapExactETHForTokens(tokenAddress, amountLD, recipient, srcEid);
	```

</details>



## H-5: Weak Randomness

The use of keccak256 hash functions on predictable values like block.timestamp, block.number, or similar data, including modulo operations on these values, should be avoided for generating randomness, as they are easily predictable and manipulable. The `PREVRANDAO` opcode also should not be used as a source of randomness. Instead, utilize Chainlink VRF for cryptographically secure and provably random values to ensure protocol integrity.

- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 282](src/kannon_v1.sol#L282)

	```solidity
	        bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp));
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 26](src/kannon_v1.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	contract KannonV1 is IERC721Receiver, Ownable, ILayerZeroComposer {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Deprecated OpenZeppelin functions should not be used

Openzeppelin has deprecated several functions and replaced with newer versions. Please consult https://docs.openzeppelin.com/

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	        TransferHelper.safeApprove(WETH9, address(swapRouter02), msg.value);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 2](src/kannon_v1.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

- Found in src/kannon_v1_library.sol [Line: 2](src/kannon_v1_library.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1_library.sol [Line: 100](src/kannon_v1_library.sol#L100)

	```solidity
	    function calculateInitialSqrtPrice(address token0, address token1, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
	```

</details>



## L-5: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>8 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/kannon_v1.sol [Line: 189](src/kannon_v1.sol#L189)

	```solidity
	        uint256 q = 2 ** 96;
	```

</details>



## L-6: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event TokenTrade(
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```

</details>



## L-10: Internal functions called only once can be inlined
